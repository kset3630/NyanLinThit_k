					interested in research and activism. It is working towards creating a
					society that values human rights and does not discriminate against
					anyone based on the ground of different categories of the people.
					Valuing diversity, our work mainly focuses on peace, human rights,
					democratic values, and multiculturalism. It publishes information and
					research surveys on current political movements and policy making, and
					efforts are made to engage with the public, political leaders, and
					relevant authorities.
